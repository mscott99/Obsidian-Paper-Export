# Statement
For every positive integer $n$, the sum of the first $n$ odd integers is equal to $n^2$.

# Proof
We proceed by induction.

Base case ($n = 1$): The sum of the first odd integer (1) is equal to $1^2$, which is true.

Inductive step: Assume that the sum of the first $k$ odd integers is equal to $k^2$. We want to show that the sum of the first $k+1$ odd integers is equal to $(k+1)^2$.

The sum of the first $k$ odd integers is $k^2$. The next odd integer is $(2k+1)$. Therefore, the
