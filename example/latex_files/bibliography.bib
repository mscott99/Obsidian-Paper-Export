  abstract     = {This paper improves upon best-known guarantees for exact reconstruction of a sparse signal f from a small universal sample of Fourier measurements. The method for reconstruction that has recently gained momentum in the sparse approximation theory is to relax this highly nonconvex problem to a convex problem and then solve it as a linear program. We show that there exists a set of frequencies such that one can exactly reconstruct every r-sparse signal f of length n from its frequencies in , using the convex relaxation, and has size k.r; n/ D O.r log.n/ log2.r/ log.r log n// D O.r log4 n/: A random set satisfies this with high probability. This estimate is optimal within the log log n and log3 r factors. We also give a relatively short argument for a similar problem with k.r; n/ rŒ12 C 8 log.n=r/ Gaussian measurements. We use methods of geometric functional analysis and probability theory in Banach spaces, which makes our arguments quite short.},
